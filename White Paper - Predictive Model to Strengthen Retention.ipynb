    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "Factors that lead employees to consider leaving the organization are a challenge for organizations,resulting in lost productivity, increased hiringcosts, and reduced team morale (De Winne et al.,2019). This project investigated factors leading tothe exit consideration of the federal workforce by analyzing survey data from the Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS) between 2020 and 2024. Using a combination of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques, predictive models were developed to classify whether an employee would consider leaving their agency. Key steps included: (a) handling class imbalance through Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), (b) encoding categorical features, and (c) transforming ordinal Likert-scale survey itemsinto binary predictors. Three classification algorithms—logistic regression, decision tree, and XGBoost—were evaluated using accuracy,\n",
    "precision, recall, and F1-score. Although the XGBoost model achieved the highest overall accuracy (81%) and provided meaningful feature insights, its recall for the minority leave class was limited, which highlights a challenge of detecting at-risk employees. Feature importance analysis revealed that employee recognition, role clarity, and supervisor alignment are critical predictors of turnover intent. Notably, gender emerged as a top predictive feature, suggesting the need for future fairness analysis. This study provided a data-driven framework for human resources (HR) teams to proactively identify and support employees who are considering leaving the organization.\n"

    "### Background and Problem Statement\n",
    "Employee turnover is a costly, noisy, and complex challenge for organizations. Research shows that replacing managers or technical professionals can cost up to 200% of their annual salary, and for other roles, up to 80% (Tatel & Wigert, 2024). \n",
    "Beyond the financial burden, the scale of the problem is significant; according to Tatal and Wigert, over half of U.S. employees are actively seeking new job opportunities. This creates instability, disrupts team performance, and increases recruitment and training demands that could have been mitigated\n",
    "\n",
    "An employee’s decision to leave is shaped by a wide range of experiences—how supported they feel in their work, the quality of their team relationships, their trust in their direct and senior leadership team, their day-to-day satisfaction, and whether they feel recognized and rewarded for their contributions.\r\n",
    "This multidimensional nature of employee experience means that solving turnover requires more than just addressing pay or workload—it demands a deeper, data-driven understanding of the interconnected factors influencing retention\n",
